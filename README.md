# Sanya Gupta's Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository! This collection showcases various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) projects that I have worked on using different algorithms and models, including logistic regression, neural networks, and more. These projects are focused on real-world problems and are based on publicly available datasets, primarily from Kaggle.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

1. **Mushroom Classification using Logistic Regression**  
   This project involves classifying mushrooms as poisonous or edible using logistic regression. The model is trained on the Mushroom dataset from Kaggle and demonstrates the power of classification models.

2. **Cat vs Dog Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**  
   A classic image classification project where the model distinguishes between images of cats and dogs. Implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing.

3. **Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**  
   This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using an ANN model. The dataset is preprocessed, and the model is trained to predict whether a customer will leave or stay.

4. **Diabetes Prediction using Naive Bayes**  
   The goal of this project is to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various health factors using the Naive Bayes classification algorithm.

5. **3D Placement Data with Gradient Descent**  
   An application of gradient descent for predicting student placements based on 3D placement data, with a focus on optimization and convergence of the model.

6. **KNN for Movie Dataset**  
   Implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the genre of a movie based on its features. This project explores classification using KNN.

7. **KNN for Titanic Survival Prediction**  
   A classic machine learning problem where the KNN algorithm is applied to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on features like age, class, and more.

8. **Next Word Prediction using Kaggle Dataset (BI-LSTM)**  
   A Bidirectional LSTM (BI-LSTM) model to predict the next word in a sentence. This deep learning model showcases sequence prediction in NLP tasks.

9. **3D Placement Data using Gradient Descent**  
   Similar to the previous project but here, the focus is on using Gradient Descent for predicting student placement based on 3D data with a focus on optimization.

10. **Placement Prediction using Gradient Descent**  
    This project applies gradient descent optimization to predict student placements based on various parameters like academic scores, skills, etc.

11. **Wine Quality Prediction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
    A regression problem where we predict wine quality based on chemical features. PCA is applied to reduce dimensionality and improve the model's performance.
